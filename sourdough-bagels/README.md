# Sourdough Bagels
Makes 12 bagels. This recipe was taken from [The Perfect Loaf](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/sourdough-bagel/) without all the fluff.

## Materials
### Levain
* \> 500 mL glass jar or container with a loose fitting lid (I've found the
  [750mL Bernardin wide mouth
  jar](https://www.homehardware.ca/en/9-pack-750ml-wide-mason-jars/p/4448184) to
  be very good)
* Scale that can measure grams with a resolution of at least 1g
* Mixing utensil (I like a rubber spatula)

### Dough
* Large bowl
* Plastic wrap or a damp dishtowel
* Bench scraper

### Proof
* Medium bowl
* Linen tea towel

### Baking
* Dutch oven
* Parchment paper
* Very sharp knife/razor blade
* Cooling rack

## Ingredients
### Levain
* 116g bread flour
* 58g (78 &deg;F) water (50%)
* 23g sourdough starter (20%)

### Dough
* 848g bread flour
* 472g water at 90&deg;F with 47g (~10%) separated
* 29g sugar, caster
* 29g barley malt syrup
* 18g salt
* 7g diastatic malt powder
* 197g [levain](#levain-1)

## Procedure
### Levain
Prepare the night before mixing the dough.
1. Mix [ingredients](#levain-1) together in a mixing bowl and knead until smooth.
2. Transfer to a narrow and tall \> 500mL glass jar/container.
3. Let the container sit in an environment with a consistent 78&deg;F ambient
   temperature, which I will refer to as the proofing environment, for 12 hours
   or when the levain levels out and begins to fall. I use my oven with the
   light on as my proofing environment.

### Autolyse
Start **~1 hour** before the levain is ripe.
1. Mix **425g water** into the [bread flour](#dough-1) until everything is just hydrated.
2. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp dishtowel and place in the
   proofing environment alongside the levain.
3. Let the dough rest until the levain is ready.

### Dough
1. To create the malt syrup slurry, combine the **barley malt syrup, sugar, diastatic malt powder, salt, and the remaining water** in a small mixing bowl and stir until everything dissolves.
2. Mix the **malt syrup slurry and levain** into the **dough** with your hands until well incorparated.
3. Turn the dough out to a clean work surface and knead the dough like pasta: fold half over onto itself and push the mass away from you with the palm of your hand. 
4. Continue folding over and pushing away for 8-10 minutes until the dough firms up, and it becomes hard to knead any further.

### Bulk Fermentation
This process will take a total of **~3 hours**.
1. Transfer your dough to a bulk fermentation container and cover.
2. Let the dough rest in your proofing environment for **1 hour and 30 minutes**.
3. For the stretch and fold, turn the dough out to a clean work surface and fold it into thirds.
4. Place the dough back into the bulk fermentation container with its seam side down, and cover.
5. Let the dough rest in your proofing environment for the rest of the bulk fermentation.

### Shaping
1. Spread a thin layer of **cornmeal** on a baking sheet that will fit in your refrigerator to prevent the bagel dough from sticking during proofing.
2. Divide the dough into 12 **~125g** pieces.
3. Degas one piece by tamping down a bit with your hand and form a rough rectangle.
4.

# Biang Biang Noodles
This recipe is just for making biang biang noodles and doesn't include
toppings. I usually pair the noodles with [bo kho](../bo-kho). This is
adapted from the autolyse method from this
[video](https://youtu.be/SiBnK5DcWCU) and this [Reddit
post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/axyghr/recipe_biang_biang_noodles_with_chili_oil_topping/)
but just the parts about the noodles. I recommend watching the video before
attempting the recipe to really understand the stretching technique.

## Ingredients
This is for one portion. You can reduce and increase the flour if you'd like
and just adjust the water and salt accordingly based on the percentages. I
just found that 100g makes enough noodles for a solid bowl of bo kho for
dinner.

## Procedure
### Autolyse
1. In a bowl, combine the salt and the flour. Then slowly drizzle in the water,
   mixing with your hands as you go. Aim for the dry bits when you’re drizzling
   the water. The purpose here’s to try to make everything nice and
   well-distributed – this way, you don’t need to knead for very long into order
   to evenly hydrate the flour.
2. Knead for about ~1 minute until the dough just comes together, then cover
   with a plate and set aside for 30 minutes.

### Shaping
1. Knead for a couple minutes until smooth.
2. If there is a more craggly, uneven side, pinch that side together, then
push the dough around the work surface in different directions to let the
friction clean up that pinch.
3. Split the dough into four. In the same way as the previous step, pinch the
sides that were cut, then roll the dough into ~5"-6" logs. Feel free to split
these into more (6-8) logs to make shorter noodles so they are less likely to
break when pulling.
4. Put logs in a lidded container that's large enough to fit them in one layer.
5. Add oil to container until logs are covered and toss logs to make sure all
   sides are coated.
6. Cover container with a lid and rest for 2 hours.
7. Move container to fridge until ready to cook.

### Cooking
1. Get a pot of water to a rapid boil. Once these noodles are done being made,
   they go straight into the pot.
2. Take a log, and flatten it out with a rolling pin or your hand into a
   rectangle shape. The noodle should be around 1/16" thick.
3. Press down the middle of the noodle with a chopstick. That indent will be
   where the noodle tears after it is stretched out.
4. With your palms facing up, hold an end of the noodle in each palm and press
   down lightly with your thumbs, so that the middle of the noodle is drooping
   down between your hands.
5. In a downwards motion with both arms, smack the middle of the noodle against
   your work surface multiple times to stretch it out until it feels like it's
   about to tear. The noodle will stretch to ~1 metre.
6. There are a few different ways that the noodle can be ripped and it's
   entirely up to you. It can be ripped along the indent:
    * into two separate noodles
    * at one end with the other end left connected so that it becomes one very
      long noodles
    * into a circle with both ends left connected
7. Boil the noodles for ~1 minute until it floats. Take them out as soon as it
   floats because you really don't want them to be over done.
8. Top with whatever toppings you want right away. They dry and stick together
   really quickly, so make sure to top them as soon as they're out of the pot.

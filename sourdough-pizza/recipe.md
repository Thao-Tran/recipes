# Sourdough Pizza Recipe
Makes 4 ~10 inch New York-style pizzas.

## Materials
### Dough
* Thermometer
* Large bowl
* Damp dish towel
* Bench scraper
### Sauce
* Medium saucepan
* Food processor

## Ingredients
### Dough (70% hydration)
* 98g sourdough starter (14% inoculation)
* 700g bread flour
* 490g water at 90&deg;F
* 14g salt (2%)
### Sauce
* 28 fl. oz can of whole peeled tomatoes
* 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 tbsp salted butter
* 2 medium cloves of garlic, grated (~2 tbsp)
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1 tsp dried basil
* Pinch of red pepper flakes
* Kosher salt
* 1 medium yellow onion, peeled and cut in half
* 1 tsp sugar

## Procedure
### Dough
1. Mix starter into water and try to break up the starter as well as you can,
but pockets of starter in the water is still okay. The point of this step is
to help with incorporating the starter into the dough.
2. Mix salt into flour in a large bowl with your hand.
3. Pour starter-water mixture into the flour and mix using your hand until
all of the flour is hydrated and everything is incorporated.
4. Do the [Rubaud method](../sourdough/recipe.md#dough-1) to develop gluten
until the dough becomes smooth and less sticky (about 5-8 minutes in total).
You can take breaks while doing this because it's crazy tiring.
### Bulk Fermentation
This process will take a total of 2.5 hours.
1. Cover the bowl with a damp dish towel and let it rest in an environment
with a consistent ~78&deg;F ambient temperature, which I will refer to as the
proofing environment, for 30 minutes. I just use my oven with the light on as
my proofing environment.
2. Perform a [stretch and fold](../sourdough/recipe.md#bulk-fermentation).
3. Repeat steps **1** and **2** two more times for a total of 3 stretch and
folds over 1.5 hours.
4. Let rest in the proofing environment for one hour.
### Proofing
1. Perform a stretch and fold then scrape the dough onto a clean **unfloured**
work surface.
2. Shape the dough into a smooth ball by using the bench scraper in one hand
to scrape under the dough and push it away from you then rotating and tucking
the dough with the other hand to create tension on the surface of the dough.

process.
3. Grease the bowl with the extra-virgin olive oil and place the dough inside
the bowl.
4. Swirl the dough around in the bowl to get the oil on the sides and then
seal with plastic wrap.
5. Place the bowl in the refrigerator to rest overnight (~14 hours).

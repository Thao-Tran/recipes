# Sourdough Pizza Recipe
Makes 4 ~10 inch New York-style pizzas. I pretty much just follow this
[video](https://youtu.be/yMfOyJeIz8c) exactly, so you should watch it to get
a general idea of what these instructions mean.

## Materials
### Dough
* Thermometer
* Large bowl
* Damp dish towel
* Bench scraper
* Plastic wrap
### Sauce
* Medium saucepan
* Food processor
### Baking
#### Option 1
* Pizza stone
* Pizza peel
#### Option 2
* Cast iron skillet
* Spatula that won't melt

## Ingredients
### Dough (70% hydration)
* 98g sourdough starter (14% inoculation)
* 700g bread flour
* 490g water at 90&deg;F
* 14g salt (2%)
### Sauce
* 28 fl. oz can of whole peeled tomatoes
* 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 tbsp salted butter
* 2 medium cloves of garlic, grated (~2 tbsp)
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1 tsp dried basil
* Pinch of red pepper flakes
* Kosher salt
* 1 medium yellow onion, peeled and cut in half
* 1 tsp sugar

## Procedure
### Dough
1. Mix starter into water and try to break up the starter as well as you can,
but pockets of starter in the water is still okay. The point of this step is
to help with incorporating the starter into the dough.
2. Mix salt into flour in a large bowl with your hand.
3. Pour starter-water mixture into the flour and mix using your hand until
all of the flour is hydrated and everything is incorporated.
4. Do the [Rubaud method](../sourdough/recipe.md#dough-1) to develop gluten
until the dough becomes smooth and less sticky (about 5-8 minutes in total).
You can take breaks while doing this because it's crazy tiring.
### Bulk Fermentation
This process will take a total of 2.5 hours.
1. Cover the bowl with a damp dish towel and let it rest in an environment
with a consistent ~78&deg;F ambient temperature, which I will refer to as the
proofing environment, for 30 minutes. I just use my oven with the light on as
my proofing environment.
2. Perform a [stretch and fold](../sourdough/recipe.md#bulk-fermentation).
3. Repeat steps **1** and **2** two more times for a total of 3 stretch and
folds over 1.5 hours.
4. Let rest in the proofing environment for one hour.
### Proofing
1. Perform a stretch and fold then scrape the dough onto a clean **unfloured**
work surface.
2. Shape the dough into a tight boule by using the bench scraper in one hand
to scrape under the dough and push it away from you then rotating and tucking
the dough with the other hand to create tension on the surface of the dough.
This [video](https://youtu.be/yMfOyJeIz8c?t=265) has a good visual of the
process.
3. Grease the bowl with the extra-virgin olive oil and place the dough inside
the bowl.
4. Swirl the dough around in the bowl to get the oil on the sides and then
seal with plastic wrap.
5. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator
overnight (~14 hours).
### Shaping
1. Lightly grease a baking sheet.
3. Dump the dough onto a clean **unfloured** work surface.
2. Cut the dough into four ~320g sections.
4. Shape each section into a tight boule (I'm pretty much just transcribing
[this](https://youtu.be/yMfOyJeIz8c?t=353)):
    a) Fold every edge of the section into the middle and stitch it up so
    they all stay together in the middle and it looks circular.
    b) Flip the dough over so the the stitched side is against the table.
    c) Spin the ball in one spot with your hands, similar to how you [shaped
    the dough for the overnight proof](#proofing). This creates tension on
    the surface of the boule.
    d) Once the boule is fairly tight, drag the bottom of the boule against
    the table with your pinkies to create more tension.
    e) Turn the boule 90&deg; and do the same thing. Continue doing this
    until the boule is very tight.
5. Place the boules in the greased baking sheet and dust the tops with flour.
6. Invert a similar sized baking sheet and place on top of the baking sheet
to cover. If you don't have another baking sheet, you can use plastic wrap
instead.
7. Let rest for 4-5 hours. Put the baking sheet in the refrigerator
afterwards until you start baking the pizzas. The dough can be stored in the
refrigerator for up to 2 days.
### Sauce
I use this
[recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/10/new-york-style-pizza-sauce.html),
but I use dried basil instead of basil sprigs because I'm not fancy enough to
have basil sprigs. This sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
1. Process tomatoes and their juice through food mill, pulse in food
processor until pureed, or puree with hand blender. Puree should not be
completely smooth, but should have no chunks larger than 1/16 of an inch. Set
tomatoes aside.
2. Combine butter and oil in medium saucepan and heat over medium-low heat
until butter is melted.
3. Add garlic, oregano, basil, pepper flakes, and large pinch of salt and
cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant but not browned (~3 minutes).
4. Add tomatoes, onion halves, and sugar. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to
lowest setting (bubbles should barely be breaking the surface), and cook,
stirring occasionally, until reduced by 1/2 (~1 hour).
5. Discard onions. Season to taste with salt.
### Baking
#### Option 1
1. Preheat the oven to the highest temperature it can go with the pizza stone
inside for 1 hour.
2. Once done preheating, using floured hands, take one circle of dough from
the baking sheet and place on a very floured pizza peel. Make sure the
peel is fairly floured so that the pizza can easily slide off the peel, then
carefully press the dough out using your hands until it reaches the thinness
that you want.
3. Put the sauce and toppings on the pizza.
4. Slide the pizza onto the pizza stone in the oven. Bake until the bottom of
the pizza is golden brown with dark spots like leopard-spots and the pizza
can hold itself up when lifted (3-5 minutes). Make sure the toppings don't
get too burnt either.
5. Remove the pizza from the stone with the peel and place on a cutting board
to cool and then cut with a pizza roller.
#### Option 2
This is what I do because I haven't gotten around to buying a pizza stone or
a pizza peel.
1. Preheat the oven to the highest temperature it can go with the cast iron
skillet inside for 1 hour.
2. Once done preheating, using floured hands, take one circle of dough from
the baking sheet and place on a very floured work surface. Make sure the
dough is fairly floured so that it doesn't stick to the work surface, then
carefully press the dough out using your hands until it has a diameter of ~9
inches.
3. Take the cast iron skillet out of the oven and place it over medium heat.
4. Place the dough into the skillet and try to center the dough and press out
the dough so that it reaches the sides. The dough doesn't have to reach the
sides, but it just looks nicer that way.
5. Put the sauce and toppings on the pizza. Keep the skillet on the stove
until the bottom of the pizza is light brown. Use a **non-plastic** spatula
to lift an edge of the pizza to check.
6. Place the skillet in the oven until the bottom of the pizza is golden
brown with dark spots like leopard-spots and the pizza can hold itself up
when lifted (3-5 minutes). Make sure the toppings don't get too burnt either.
7. Remove the pizza from the skillet and place on a cutting board to cool and
then cut with a pizza roller.

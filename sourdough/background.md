Here I'm going to cover some background information on things that I mention in
the main documents.

## Sourdough Starter
The foundation of every sourdough bread is its starter. A starter is a mixture
of flour and water fermented by a stable symbiotic culture of bacteria and
yeast. When water is added to flour, which naturally contains a variety of
yeasts and bacteria, enzymes are activated and begin to break down large starch
molecules into smaller sugar molecules for the naturally occurring yeast to
metabolize. Byproducts of the yeast are alcohol and carbon dioxide gas, which is
what raises the dough. The lactic acid bacteria ferment starches that the yeast
can't metabolize and produces lactic acid, which gives the "sour" taste to
sourdough. The lactic acid is beneficial to the yeast since yeast grows best in
a slightly acidic environment.

Sourdough starter must be regularly replenished with new flour and water to
provide food for the bacteria and yeast, though the starter activity can be
slowed down by lowering its temperature, i.e. putting it in the fridge.

## Hydration Level
When talking about dough, the hydration level is the percentage of the mass of
the water compared to the mass of the flour. For example, a dough with 500g of
flour and 250g of water is a 50% hydation dough. The hydration gets a little
complicated when you add a starter to the mix because you'll have to take into
account the hydration of the starter as well. A dough with 500g of flour, 200g
of water, and 200g of a 100% hydration starter is a 50% hydration dough, since
the 100% hydration starter would have 100g of flour and 100g of water.

## Inoculation
Inoculation is the percentage of starter compared to the flour. For example, a
dough with 500g of flour and 200g of starter has a 40% inoculation.  The
inoculation when feeding a starter is a large factor of the speed of the
fermentation. A higher inoculation will result in a faster ferment and a lower
inoculation will result in a slower ferment. This is because there will be more
active yeast and bacteria present in a feeding with higher inoculation which
will metabolize the new food quicker compared to a lower inoculation.

## Flour
The type of flour has a large influence on the fermentation process. The protein
in flour, when hydrated, kneaded, and/or fermented, produces gluten, which
allows for bread to increase in volume and trap air inside the bread. The more
protein there is in the flour, the more gluten that can be developed in the
dough. Some flour types with higher protein content are rye and whole wheat.
Rye, in particular, contains a high level of enzymes and yeast varieties, which
speeds up the fermentation process.

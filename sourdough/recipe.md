# Sourdough Recipe
This recipe is pretty much just a transcription of Joshua Weissman's video,
[The Ultimate Homemade Sourdough Bread](https://youtu.be/jJpIzr2sCDE), so
giving that video a watch before following this recipe will probably give
some good context and visuals that you wouldn't get when just reading through
this recipe. I also linked important timestamps in this video and other
videos at various steps.

## Materials
### Levain
* \> 500 mL glass jar or container with a loose fitting lid (I've found the
  [750mL Bernardin wide mouth
  jar](https://www.homehardware.ca/en/9-pack-750ml-wide-mason-jars/p/4448184) to
  be very good)
* Scale that can measure grams with a resolution of at least 1g
* Mixing utensil (I like a rubber spatula)

### Dough
* Large bowl
* Plastic wrap or a damp dishtowel
* Bench scraper

### Proof
* Medium bowl
* Linen tea towel

### Baking
* Dutch oven
* Parchment paper
* Very sharp knife/razor blade
* Cooling rack

## Ingredients
### One loaf
#### Levain
* 18g starter
* 18g rye flour
* 18g unbleached all-purpose flour
* 36g room temperature (78&deg;F) water

#### Dough (~85% hydration)
* 90g levain (~20% inoculation)
* 403g bread flour
* 37g rye flour
* 367g water at 90&deg;F with 40g (~11%) separated
* 10g salt (~2%)

### Two loaves
#### Levain
* 35g starter
* 35g rye flour
* 35g unbleached all-purpose flour
* 70g room temperature (78&deg;F) water

#### Dough (~85% hydration)
* 185g levain (~20% inoculation) 
* 811g bread flour
* 75g rye flour
* 740g water at 90&deg;F with 80g (~11%) separated
* 18g salt (~2%)

## Procedure
### Levain
1. Combine all of the ingredients in a \> 500mL glass jar/container.
2. Let the container sit in an environment with a consistent 78&deg;F ambient
   temperature, which I will refer to as the proofing environment, for 5-6 hours
   or when the levain levels out and begins to fall. I use my oven with the
   light on as my proofing environment.

### Autolyse
Begin about 3.5 hours into the levain fermentation.
1. Combine the bread flour and rye flour in a large bowl with your hands.
2. Mix 660g water into the flour until everything is just hydrated.
3. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp dishtowel and place in the
   proofing environment alongside the levain.
4. Let the dough rest until the levain is ready (approx. 1.5 hours).

### Dough
Begin when the levain is ready.
1. Add the levain to the dough in the bowl.
2. Wet your hand using the reserved 80g of water so that the dough doesn't stick
   to your hand and spread the starter out on the dough. You can continue to
   splash some (**not all**) of the reserved water to help spread the starter.
3. Begin to incorporate the starter into the dough by creating dimples around
   the top and then stirring the dough around until the dough comes together and
   pulls away from the bowl.
4. Scoop the dough from underneath and slap the dough back down. Repeat this
   motion until everything is incorporated (30 seconds to 1 minute).

Steps **3** and **4** describe the [Rubaud
method](https://youtu.be/zgz0oAhgwyg?t=39), which is an effective mixing
technique for wet (>65% hydration) doughs. Steps **5-9** describe the [slap and
fold method](https://youtu.be/jJpIzr2sCDE?t=177) and are optional since it kind
of makes a mess and requires a large work surface. The slap and fold method can
be replaced by continuing to do the Rubaud method until the dough becomes smooth
and less sticky (3-5 minutes).

5. Scrape the dough out of the bowl onto a clean work surface with **no flour**.
6. Pick the dough up with both hands by scooping under it on both sides and
   lifting up.
7. Slap the bottom of the dough down onto the work surface and fold it over
   itself.
8. Repeat steps 10 and 11 until the dough becomes smooth and less sticky (3-5
   minutes).
9. Place the dough back in the bowl.
10. Cover the bowl and let it rest in the proofing environment for 25 minutes.
11. Add the salt and the remaining water.
12. Incorporate using the Rubaud method until everything is incorporated (30
    seconds to 1 minute).
13. Perform the slap and fold method or continue with the Rubaud method until
    the dough becomes smooth and less sticky (3-5 minutes).

### Bulk Fermentation
This process will take a total of ~4 hours.
1. Cover the bowl and let it rest in the proofing environment for 15 minutes.
2. With a wet hand, grab one edge of the dough, stretch the dough as far as it
   can without tearing, and fold it over to the other side.
3. Turn the bowl 90&deg;.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the bowl has gone 360&deg; around, i.e. you've
   done the process for every side.

Steps **2-4** describe the [stretch and fold
method](https://youtu.be/jJpIzr2sCDE?t=236), which helps with gluten
development.

5. Repeat steps 1-4 two times for a total of three "stretch and fold"s over 45
   minutes.
6. Repeat steps 1-4 three times with a 30 minute rest instead of 15 minutes for
   a total of three "stretch and fold"s over 1.5 hours (90 minutes).
7. Cover the bowl and let it dough rest in the proofing environment for the
   remainder of the bulk fermentation (approx. 1 hour and 45 minutes).

### Shaping
1. Gently dump the dough onto an **unfloured** work surface and, if making
   [two loaves](#two-loaves), cut in half with a dampened bench scraper and
   dampened hands.
2. Pre-shape dough(s) into loose boule(s). The technique can be seen in this
   [video](https://youtu.be/vEG1BjWroT0?t=247).
3. Let the loose boule(s) rest uncovered for 20 minutes.
4. Use a bench scraper to help lift one of the boules and place it in front
   of you on an unfloured work surface.
5. Lightly flour the top of the boule and make sure it's covered in a thin
   layer of flour.
6. Use a bench scraper to loosen the dough from the work surface, support
   the dough and gently flip it so that the floured top is now on the work
   surface.

Steps **7-13** is my attempt at explaining the Tartine dough shaping method
in words, but it'll just be a lot easier if you watch this
[video](https://youtu.be/jJpIzr2sCDE?t=312).

7. Stretch the bottom edge out and fold it up to the center of the dough.
8. Stretch the left side out and fold it a little past the center to the
   right.
9. Stretch the right side out and fold it over the left side.
10. Stretch the top edge out and fold it down to the center.
11. Starting at the top of the dough and working your way down to the bottom,
   take left and right edges of the dough and stretch and fold them into the
   dough.
12. Roll the dough over from the bottom to the top and gently seal the seam
   at the bottom.
13. Use the technique shown in step 2 to create more tension on the surface
   of the dough.
14. If you're making two loaves, repeat steps **5-13** with the other boule.

### Proofing
1. Line a medium bowl with a linen tea towel and generously flour the towel
   with rye flour.
2. Use a bench scraper to lift the dough, flip it over, and place it in the
   bowl such that the smooth top is against the bowl and the seam side is
   facing up.
3. If you're making two loaves, repeat steps **1** and **2** with the other
   boule.
4. Cover the bowl(s) with damp dishtowel(s) and let rest in the refrigerator
   overnight (ideally ~14 hours).

### Baking
This will occur the next morning after the dough is done proofing.
1. Preheat oven to 500&deg;F with a dutch oven and its lid inside for an hour.
2. Rip a sheet of parchment paper that is about double the diameter of the
   dough and generously flour the middle of the sheet, where the dough will
   be, with rye flour.
3. Take a bowl out of the refrigerator and flour the top so it won't stick to
   your hands when you take it out.
4. Flip the bowl over and guide the dough onto the floured area of the sheet
   of parchment paper.
5. Once the dutch oven is done preheating, take it out of the oven and place
   the dough with the parchment paper into the dutch oven using the extra
   amount of paper on each side to lower it in.
6. Score the top of the dough by using a scoring lame or a super duper sharp 
   knife at a ~30&deg; angle to cut a line down the middle of the dough. You
   can score it in whatever pattern you want really, but the line down the
   middle is the simplest.
7. Place the lid on the dutch oven and place it into the oven for 20 minutes
   at 500&deg;F.
8. Remove the lid from the dutch oven (but leave it in the oven) and continue
   to bake it at 450&deg;F until the crust browns (20-30 minutes).
9. Remove the dough from the dutch oven and let it cool at room temperature
   on a cooling rack for at least 30 minutes.

If you're making two loaves and have two dutch ovens, you can do both loaves
at the same time. If not, heat your oven, with the dutch oven and lid back
inside, to 500&deg;F and let preheat for 15 minutes before repeating steps
**2-8** with the second loaf.

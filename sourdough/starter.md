# Sourdough Starter
This covers the materials and ingredients you'll need to make your starter and
the general schedule that you should follow to get it started.

## Materials
* Glass jar or container with a loose fitting lid with a volume of at least
  500mL (I've found the [750mL Bernardin wide mouth
  jar](https://www.homehardware.ca/en/9-pack-750ml-wide-mason-jars/p/4448184)
  to be very good)
* Scale that can measure grams with a resolution of at least 1g
* Rubber spatula for mixing the starter (optional)

## Ingredients (Cumulative)
* > 400g rye flour
* > 300g unbleached all-purpose flour
* > 780g water

## Before Starting
Record the weight of your glass container without the lid in grams. I like to
write it on a piece of tape and put that on the container so I never forget. You
can also name your starter and tape that on the jar, as well, to add a little
character. I named mine "Lil' Tart". I would also suggest reading the
[Background](./background.md) document to understand what's going on inside the
starter and how certain factors affect the fermentation.

## Schedule
The starter should be fed when there's no food left for the starter. Usually it
should be between 12-24 hours, but it varies depending on the starter's
environment (ambient temperature, mostly). There are some indicators that you
should watch for to know when to feed your starter:
* The shape of the top of the starter:
    * If the top is convex, it's still growing and therefore has food left.
    * If the top is concave/flat, it's beginning to fall which means the yeast
      has no food left to metabolize and produce gas.
* The smell (if there's no visual indication):
    * If it has a strong smell of alcohol, the starter should be fed since this
      is indicative of yeast dying and being metabolized by other yeast, which
      results in a higher ratio of alcohol being produced to yeast in the
      starter.

I got this schedule from Joshua Weissman's video, [The Ultimate Sourdough
Starter Guide](https://youtu.be/sTAiDki7AQA). Remember that every starter is
going to grow differently and to just be patient and observant. The important
thing is to be knowledgable about how to adjust the variables (temperature,
inoculation, flour type) accordingly.

### Start
1. Clean container thoroughly with boiling water to make sure there aren't any
weird organisms hanging out in there.
2. Add 100g rye flour and 150g lukewarm (~85&deg;F) water.
3. Mix together until homogeneous.

### Feeding 1
1. Discard starter from container until there is only 70g left, i.e. the
   container should weigh the recorded weight + 70g starter.
2. Add 50g rye flour, 50g unbleached all-purpose flour, and 115g lukewarm water.
3. Mix together until homogeneous.

### Feeding 2
Same as [Feeding 1](#feeding-1).

### Feeding 3
1. Discard starter from container until there is only 70g left, i.e. the
   container should weigh the recorded weight + 70g starter.
2. Add 50g rye flour, 50g unbleached all-purpose flour, and 100g lukewarm water.
3. Mix together until homogeneous.

### Feeding 4
Same as [Feeding 3](#feeding-3).

### Feeding 5
1. Discard starter from container until there is only 50g left, i.e. the
   container should weigh the recorded weight + 50g starter.
2. Add 50g rye flour, 50g unbleached all-purpose flour, and 100g lukewarm water.
3. Mix together until homogeneous.

### Feeding 6
1. Discard starter from container until there is only 25g left, i.e. the
   container should weigh the recorded weight + 25g starter.
2. Add 50g rye flour, 50g unbleached all-purpose flour, and 100g lukewarm water.
3. Mix together until homogeneous.

## Maintenance
The sourdough starter will continue to need food after the feedings outlined in
[Schedule](#schedule), since these feedings just help the starter become active.
If the starter is left out at room temperature, it will need to be fed with a
similar frequency to when it was being fed before it was active (every 12-24
hours) and the process will follow [Feeding 6](#feeding-6). The starter feedings
can be slowed down to once every week by storing the starter in the
refrigerator. If the starter is stored in the refrigerator, the following steps
should be followed for every feeding:
1. Remove starter from refrigerator and let sit at room temperature.
2. Once starter reaches room temperature, follow [Feeding 6](#feeding-6).
3. Let starter ferment for 1-2 hours at room temperature.
4. Return starter to refrigerator.

The idea is that every time you feed your active starter, you'll make something
with it instead of throwing it out. Though, the starter discard should be thrown
out during the initial feedings outlined in [Schedule](#schedule) since that
starter is not yet active and might not make good food.

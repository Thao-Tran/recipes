# Bo Kho
Also known as beef stew, but the way my mom makes it. You can eat this with
[biang biang noodles](../biang-biang-noodles), pho noodles, or alone and dip
baguettes into it.

## Ingredients
### Marinade
* 1 kg bottom blade beef
* 1 tbsp salt
* 1 tsp ground black pepper
* 1 tsp garlic plus
* 2 tbsp bo kho seasoning or enough to cover the beef cubes completely
* 1 tsp chinese 5 spice
### Stew
* 2 tbsp olive oil or enough to cover the bottom of the pot
* 3/4 cup lemongrass, shredded
* 2 whole lemongrass stalks
* 10 large carrots, peeled and cut into ~2 inch long pieces
* salt to taste (usually about 1 tsp)
* fish sauce to taste (usually about 6 tbsp)
* 2 tbsp tapioca starch
* 1 cup water

## Prep
### Beef
1. Wash the beef and drain the water off in a colander.
2. Cut the beef into ~2 inch cubes.

### Lemongrass stalks
1. Peel the outer layer of the lemongrass stalks off and cut the top and
about 1 inch of the bottom off the stalks.
2. Wash the stalks and then cut into 3 - 4 inch pieces.
3. Pound the lemongrass pieces until flat and the lemongrass splits into very
thin pieces.
4. Tie the lemongrass tightly together with twine.

## Procedure
### Marinade
1. Sprinkle the salt, pepper, garlic plus, bo kho seasoning, and chinese 5
spice over the beef in a colander and mix until the beef is well covered with
all the seasoning.

### Stew
1. Pour the oil into the pot and cook on high heat until it's shiny (~2 minutes).
2. Add 1 tbsp of the shredded lemongrass to the pot and spread it apart, then
add the marinated beef cubes and the remainder of the shredded lemongrass.
3. Mix until the lemongrass covers the beef.
4. Put lid on the pot and lower heat to medium-high. Let beef cook until
browned, stirring occasionally so the beef doesn't burn.
5. Start boiling ~1.5L of water in a kettle or a separate pot.
6. Once the beef is done, pour the boiled water into the pot until the beef
is covered and add the tied lemongrass. Lower the heat to medium
and let simmer for ~2 hour.
7. After the stew has been cooking for ~30 minutes, add salt and fish sauce
to taste. If you're feeling fancy, you can also add 1 tsp mushrooom powder.
8. Skim the majority of the oil and liquid fat from the top of the stew.
9. Let sit for another 15 minutes and then add carrots to the stew.
10. After the stew has been simmering for about 1 hour and 45 minutes, mix
together the tapioca starch and water in a bowl and mix into the stew. The
stew should become thick enough to coat the back of spoon. If not, make
another mixture of 2 tbsp of tabpioca and 1 cup of water and add to the stew
a little bit at a time until thick enough.
11. Mix ground black pepper into the stew and add fish sauce to taste. Let
sit for abother 10 minutes.
12. Serve on cooked pho noodles or just in a bowl with baguettes to dip.
